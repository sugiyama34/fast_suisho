BLOCKED: --no-verify flag detected in git commit.

Why: Pre-commit hooks must never be bypassed. They enforce project safety checks.

What to do:
  Claude Code: Investigate and fix the failing hook instead of skipping it.
               If stuck, ask the user for help.
  User: Check which pre-commit hook is failing and fix the underlying issue.
